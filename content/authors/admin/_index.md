I am a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/) at the  [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) under [Dr. Indranil Saha](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/). I am a recipient of the [Prime Minister Research Fellowship](https://pmrf.in) since December-2020.
I am working on synthesis of safe and robust controllers for safety-critical Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs).
During MS, I worked on development of an automated debugging tool for CPS models. I have worked in the area of distributed systems at OptumSoft, Bangalore.   




<!-- I love working on robotics systems (mainly Aerial Robots), RC flying of fixed-wings, freestyle FPV flying of multi-rotors, playing video games, watching movies, listening music, and want my GoGoGo...Tron.    -->
